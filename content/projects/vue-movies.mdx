## Overview

Vue Movies is a web application built with Vue.js that allows users to browse, search, and stream movies and TV series online. The application integrates with the [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org) to fetch detailed information about movies and TV shows, and uses the [SuperEmbed API](https://www.superembed.stream) to provide streaming content directly within the app.

## Project Goals

The main goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience with Vue.js and strengthen my understanding of its core concepts, as I needed to work with Vue.js frontend code at my job but lacked a proper grasp of its fundamentals. By building Vue Movies, I aimed to bridge that gap, learning how to structure components, manage state, handle routing, and integrate APIs in a real-world project scenario.

## Tech Stack

This project was built using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org).

## Features

- **Movies**: Browse a vast collection of movies.  
- **TV Series**: Explore popular and trending TV shows.  
- **Search**: Easily search for your favorite movies and TV series.  
- **Streaming**: Watch movies and TV shows directly within the app.

## Learning and Takeaways

This project significantly deepened my understanding of **Vue.js fundamentals**, particularly the **Composition API** and component structure. I gained practical experience in **state management using Pinia**, dynamic routing with **Vue Router**, and **integrating multiple external APIs with Axios**. I also learned how to optimize user experience by handling asynchronous data and creating responsive layouts. Overall, Vue Movies reinforced my frontend development skills and taught me how to build maintainable, scalable, and interactive web applications.
