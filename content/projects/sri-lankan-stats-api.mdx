## Overview

Sri Lankan Statistics API is a RESTful API designed to provide detailed and structured data about Sri Lanka. It allows developers to easily fetch information such as **provinces, districts, cities, postal codes, polling districts, and polling divisions**.  

## Project Goals

The main goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience in building RESTful APIs with Laravel. I wanted to explore and practice several core concepts, including implementing authentication with Laravel Sanctum, structuring controllers, models, and request forms, managing data with migrations and seeders, and documenting endpoints using Swagger (L5-Swagger). Rather than creating a small demo, I decided to build a real-world–oriented project that provides structured data about Sri Lanka. This way, I could not only strengthen my Laravel skills through practical application but also deliver an API that has genuine value and can be used by others in real-world scenarios.

## Tech Stack

This project was built using [Laravel](https://laravel.com) for the backend, [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) for the database, and [Swagger](https://swagger.io) (via [L5-Swagger](https://github.com/DarkaOnLine/L5-Swagger)) for API documentation.

## Features

- **Provinces**: Retrieve provinces and their related districts, cities, and maps.  
- **Districts**: Get all districts, their parent province, cities, and maps.  
- **Cities**: Access cities along with their corresponding district and province.  
- **Postal Codes**: Query postal codes and their related post offices.  
- **Polling Districts & Divisions**: Fetch polling-related geographical data.  
- **Interactive API Documentation**: Explore and test endpoints with Swagger UI.  

## Learning and Takeaways

Through this project, I gained valuable hands-on experience in building RESTful APIs with Laravel, including implementing authentication with Laravel Sanctum, organizing controllers, models, and request validations, and managing data effectively using migrations and seeders. I also learned how to create interactive and well-structured API documentation with Swagger, and how to design endpoints that are both scalable and developer-friendly. Overall, this project strengthened my Laravel fundamentals and gave me the confidence to build production-ready APIs that are practical and useful in real-world applications.
