## Project Goals

I built Simple Lightbox primarily for my portfolio website, aiming for a lightweight, easy-to-use image viewer with the specific features I needed most. Along the way, I decided to turn it into an NPM package, which was a great learning experience for me since it was my first time publishing a package. I also hope that others may find it useful, while I continue to use it in my own projects. This approach allowed me to create a solution tailored to my workflow while keeping it minimal, fast, and fully under my control.

## Tech Stack

This project was built using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).

## Features

- **Lightweight Viewer**: Minimalist design focused on simplicity and speed.
- **Gallery Support**: Easily display single images or image galleries. 
- **Responsive**: Works smoothly across devices, from mobile to desktop.

## Learning and Takeaways

This project marked my first experience publishing an NPM package, making it a quite exciting and educational journey. I learned the full lifecycle of a package release, from development and bundling to versioning and publishing. It also strengthened my skills in TypeScript, Vite, and building reusable, production-ready components.
